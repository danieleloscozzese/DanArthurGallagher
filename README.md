# Daniel Arthur Gallagher

I'm a gay software engineer (now a senior!) from Scotland and I live in Milan in Italy.

I use the masculine pronouns "he", "him" and "his" ‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## Work üíª

I work for [Subito.it](https://www.subito.it/), an online marketplace and the biggest one in Italy,
and I'm a generalist developer and with a focus on the front-end.

Since joining the company, I've worked on rebuilding the front-end
of the listing and detail pages, and rolling out a rebrand of the site.

In recent months we've been focussed on more specific improvements in the search
product and improving the display.

My team focussed on web performance in Q2 of 2020 and with an effort across the whole company we
made a revolution in the performance of the site, as well as how we track it and think about it.
In 2021 I've worked to deepen our tooling on these themes with better monitoring of Core Web Vitals,
management of problems raised from Lighthouse and Google Search Console, and a transition towards
Real-User Metrics.

I have quite a bit of experience conducting technical interviews, which started at the BBC
and that I have been able to continue with in Subito for a large and long round of hiring.
I enjoy doing this, and try both to make sure that we get the information that we need about the
candidate and that the candidate has a positive experience.

## Studying

### Tech ‚ö°

I've used some [Go](https://golang.org/) to get more involved in creating and maintaining our services,
and managed to launch a small service which I wrote mostly by myself.

I'm also signed up for the Linux Foundation's
[Kubernetes for Developers](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-for-developers/)
course and will study it towards the
[Certified Kubernetes Application Developer](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-application-developer-ckad/)
exam. It's paid for by my annual training budget, so I'm getting a good deal.

### Italian üáÆüáπ

I'm a student at the [Dante Alighieri Society](https://www.dante.global/) and am also studying a diploma in Italian
at the [National University of Ireland, Galway](https://www.nuigalway.ie/).

I'm certified to B1 in Italian and am preparing myself to sit a B2 PLIDA exam in December 2021.
