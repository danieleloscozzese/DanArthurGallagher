# Daniel Arthur Gallagher

I'm a senior software engineer from Scotland, I'm gay, and I live in Milan in Italy.


## Work ðŸ’»

I work for [Subito.it](https://www.subito.it/), an online marketplace â€“
the biggest in Italy â€“
and as a front-end developer, strong not just on JS but HTML and CSS from a
career I started at 19 years old in 2014 as an apprentice.

Since joining the company, I've worked on rebuilding the front-end
of the listing and detail pages, and rolling out a rebrand of the site;
enhancing performance both as a key focus and as part of business as usual,
developing various search features (including a radius search on a map) and
running A/B tests to improve specific pieces of the UI.

I have quite a bit of experience conducting technical interviews, starting
from experience at the BBC,
and I have been able to continue in Subito for a number of rounds of hiring.
I enjoy interviewing, and try both to make sure that we get the information
that we need about the
candidate and that the candidate has a positive experience.

## Studying

### Tech âš¡

I use the Core Web Vitals as a key metric on a daily basis and follow blogs from
Google and other developers to learn about ways to optimize and improve what I ship.

I've recently started to focus on writing better JS, with a focus on a 
maximal use of the language and it's vocabulary and syntax to get more runtime
guarantees from the code.

### Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

I'm a student at the [Dante Alighieri Society](https://www.dante.global/) and am studying towards a C1 exam.
