# Daniel Arthur Gallagher

I'm a gay software engineer from Scotland and I live in Milan in Italy.

I use the masculine pronouns "he", "him" and "his".

## Work

I work for [Subito.it](https://www.subito.it), an online marketplace,
and I'm a generalist developer and with a front-end specialism.

Since joining the company, I've worked on rebuilding the front-end
of the listing and detail pages, and rolling out a rebrand of the site.

In recent months we've been focussed on more specific improvements in the search
product and improving certain aspects of the display.

My team focussed on web performance in Q2 of 2020 and with an effort across the whole company we
made a revolution in the performance of the site, as well as how we track it and think about it.

I've used some [Go](https://golang.org) to get more involved in creating and maintaining our services,
and managed to launch a small service which I wrote almost by myself.

I have quite a bit of experience conducting interviews, which started at the BBC
and that I have been able to continue with in Subito, and it's great to also
work on the human side of the field when the need arises.

## Life

I'm a student at the Dante Alighieri Society and am also studying a diploma in Italian
at the [National University of Ireland, Galway](https://www.nuigalway.ie).

I'm certified to B1 in Italian and am studying for the C1 PLIDA exam.
